// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MIR -> Native IR (instruction selection)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This is the native backend's entry point, and the only place it reads MIR.
//
// Two rules define it, and they are the reason the file exists at all:
//
//   1. **It consumes verified MIR and nothing else.** No AST, no type checker,
//      no re-derivation of what an expression meant. Every fact selection acts
//      on - the class of a value, the operand order of a subtraction, which
//      block a branch goes to - is read out of the MIR the verifier accepted.
//      If a fact is not in the MIR, the answer is to put it in the MIR, not to
//      reconstruct it here.
//
//   2. **Refusal is a first-class result.** The native subset is small on
//      purpose. Everything outside it is *rejected by name*, per function, with
//      the MIR opcode and source line that caused the rejection; the caller
//      keeps running that function on the VM. A backend that guesses at an
//      operation it does not implement is worse than one that admits it, and a
//      silently mis-lowered arithmetic operation is the single hardest class of
//      bug to find later.
//
// The subset selected today, stated exactly:
//
//   * value classes Integer (ZL int, bool) and Float (ZL double);
//   * integer and double constants;
//   * add/sub/mul/div/mod/neg on both, and the integer bitwise operations;
//   * all six comparisons on both, and boolean not/and/or;
//   * int -> double widening;
//   * Load/Store of primitive slots;
//   * Jump, Branch, Return, Unreachable;
//   * direct Call to another function that is itself in the subset, plus
//     CallRuntime for anything explicitly routed to the runtime.
//
// Everything else - references, objects, strings, collections, closures,
// exceptions, async, ownership events - is refused. Reference *values* are
// refused rather than treated as integers, because an untracked reference is
// exactly the failure mode that cannot be diagnosed after the fact.
